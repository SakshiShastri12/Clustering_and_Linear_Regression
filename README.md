# Clustering_and_Linear_Regression

## Project Overview
This repository contains two HTML-based data science reports generated as part of coursework and practical assignments.
The two reports are:

- Ass5Kmeans-Clustering.html
- Sakshi_Shastri_LinearRegression.html

Each file represents a complete analysis including code, plots, and results.

1. Ass5Kmeans-Clustering.html
Topic: K-Means Clustering

### Contents:
- Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- Visualization of clustered data points.
- Interpretation of cluster centroids and assignment of points.
- Tools Used: Python (likely via Jupyter Notebook), scikit-learn, matplotlib.

2. Sakshi_Shastri_LinearRegression.html
Topic: Linear Regression

### Contents:
- Implementation of simple or multiple linear regression.
- Visualization of regression lines.
- Error analysis such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) or RÂ² score.
- Tools Used: Python, sklearn (linear_model), matplotlib, pandas.
